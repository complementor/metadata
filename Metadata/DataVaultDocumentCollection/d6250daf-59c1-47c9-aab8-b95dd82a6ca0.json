It seemed to get launched through the S-turns with the help of the Mustang at the start of each run which gave it a huge lead both times.  It would have most likely taken a DNF for the Mach 1 to have a chance at that point.  This win puts the F40 through to the final round where it will faceoff with the Firebird SE from team MxV.
