It&#39;s also possible that your video download speed is slow or inconsistent. In this case, you can try pausing the video until the entire stream is downloaded and then playing the video.   =)\n\nPlease note: If anyone wants the DVDs of any games, please contact me in private by going to my Youtube channel at http://www.youtube.com/BallHockeyVideos and clicking on the &quot;Send Message&quot; link to send me a message. These are lasting memories, you will have a lot of fun watching the DVDs with your buddies, with your grandchildren when you&#39;re retired, and with your teammates when you have a reunion party many years later. You can use the DVDs for training, coaching, analyzing purposes and play the DVDs at your next team meeting. You can watch the DVDs on your TV and computer monitor. You &quot;do not&quot; need to have HDTV to watch the HD videos. The video quality is excellent on normal TV and on normal computer monitor as well as HDTV. Usually each game has 2 DVDs. The video quality of the DVDs is superior and it&#39;s a lot better than the video on Youtube. Youtube process and convert the uploaded videos. Each time a video&#39;s being converted or transcoded from one type of compression to another, there will be some loss in quality, similar to making a photocopy of a photocopy. For example, the file size of a 10 minute HD video on DVD is about 53 times larger than the 10 minute video you watch on Youtube. The audio and video quality of the DVDs is superb, images are incredibly clear, crisp, sharp with amazing rich, vivid color and increased color fidelity. The audio&#39;s recorded as Dolby Digital 5.1ch surround sound, which adds an extra sense of realism when you play back the HD footage on connected 5.1ch-compatible systems. Sound quality is superb if you have the 5.1ch-compatible systems. But even if you do not have 5.1ch-compatible systems, sound quality is still excellent. Also, video playback on DVDs is &quot;not&quot; choppy at all because internet connection is &quot;not&quot; required when you play the DVDs. Therefore video playback on DVDs is very smooth.\n\nWith the DVDs, you can play, pause, rewind, fast-forward, skip backward, skip forward, stop, resume the videos easily with a touch of a button, you can also show the videos in slow motion/fast motion mode to recapture a key moment in the game like scoring chance, goal etc. Youtube do not offer the feature to play videos in slow motion/fast motion. With the use of video slow-motion replay, you can see very clearly why the referees made certain decisions. The DVDs are good for training and coaching purposes. The teams can play the DVDs in their team meeting, analyze their opponents&#39; strategies and review their own games. The DVDs also good for the players to find the weak spots of different goalies and good for the goalies to review the games.\n\nI recorded many games in different leagues. I still have the original videos of most of the games as of now so if anyone want the DVDs of any games, please contact me in private as soon as you can. The DVDs are available at a very low cost. The videos of certain games that&#39;re not on Youtube are also available on DVDs. You can pick up the DVDs or they can be mailed upon request.
