This is a really, really nice bike, a really, really expensive bicycle...he got the deluxe version -- full Dura Ace 10 speed (cassette) on the back, two (chainrings) in the front, giving you 20 speeds, with Dura Ace levers, an FSA full-carbon aero handlebar, and Dura Ace brakes. &quot;This Maavic is kinda neat,&quot; he notes. &quot;It&#39;s a fat-bladed spoke but it&#39;s extremely lightweight,&quot; noting the sealed hub and presumably titanium lollipop pedals. &quot;It&#39;s a very smooth riding machine,&quot; he adds. &quot;Because, again, everything is weight, weight, and more weight.&quot;  The damage is noticeable. &quot;We rinsed it off as best we can.

It&#39;s a shame.&quot; He points out rust and corrosion underneath the chrome-plated aluminum derailleur and on the crank arm, one of the few steel parts on the bike. &quot;You can see the brown ugly rust down the pipe on that crank,&quot; BikemanforU says, observing it&#39;s an FSA SLK carbon shell crank. &quot;Salt damage is just deadly on a bicycle.

Turn around. It&#39;s a barrier beach. You go up to it. Oh my goodness look at the water. It&#39;s flooded at high tide.. Either that, or check your tides.
