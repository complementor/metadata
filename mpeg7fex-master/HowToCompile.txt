Steps:

0. Install OpenCV 3.1.0 (or higher, anything >= 2.4 should work fine, since it only needs the Mat data structure and image loading)


Compiling the Library:

Note: On Windows, I recommend using CodeBlocks+MinGW to compile the library. If you use MSVC, then you might not get proper output (see issue #1). You should uncomment lroundf function in Extraction/imutils.c file, otherwise DCD is reported to fail with MSVC.

1. Open the CodeBlocks project file MPEG7FexLib.cbp
3. Go to Project > Build options > "Search directories" tab > Compiler
   Change the opencv include directory according to your installation.
   (On my computer it is /home/research/libs/opencv-3.1.0/include, on your computer it is probably different)
4. Go to Project > Properties > "Build targets" tab
    Change the output filename to libMPEG7Fex.a (Linux), MPEG7Fex.lib (Windows) or any other name you like
    
5. Compile the project. It should compile and generate the library  libMPEG7Fex.a/MPEG7Fex.lib under the "lib" directory

Compiling the test code under the "test" directory (it uses the library to extract features from the images).
1. Go to the "test" directory
2. Open the CodeBlocks project file MPEG7LibTest.cbp
3. Go to Go to Project > Properties > "Build targets" tab
    Change the output filename to MPEG7Test (Linux) MPEG7Test.exe (Windows)  (or any other name, xyx, xyz.exe your program's name)
4. Go to Project > Build options > "Search directories" tab > Compiler
   Change the opencv "include" directory according to your installation (as above)
   (On my computer it is /home/research/libs/opencv-3.1.0/include, on your computer it is probably different)

   Change the opencv "lib" directory directory according to your installation
   (On my computer it is /home/research/libs/opencv-3.1.0/lib, on your computer it is probably different)
   
   Go to "linker settings" tab
   Change the link libraries according to your computer.
   For example, change "MPEG7FexLib" (Linux) to "MPEG7Fex.lib" (Windows) (this is the library you compiled above)
   For the other opencv libraries, check the opencv "lib" directory and find the correct filenames and modify them
5. Compile the project and obtain the MPEG7Test / MPEG7Test.exe (or whatever name you gave your program above, in step 3)
6. Run the program
   If you run it from CodeBlocks, it will compute some of the descriptors on the 'motor.jpg' image in the test directory.
   If you run it from the command line and give it a new image, it will work on that image:
   $ MPEG7Test image.jpg  (Linux)
   $ MPEG7Test.exe image.jpg  (Windows)
